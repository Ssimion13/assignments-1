The project assignment is to create a fictitious business website with html, css, and JS. Additionally, the website must be responsive to all screen sizes, have Inline/Block elements, divs & spans, images, at least one list, headers/paragraphs, semantic HTML, multiple HTML pages (linked), and use the CSS box model (margin, padding, border, width/height).

I learned a lot about both making websites responsive and making a horizontal list, and also more working with images and the Chrome dev tools.
